Bower is a package manager for the web. Web sites are made of lots of things: frameworks, libraries, assets, utlities, and rainbows. Bower manages all this stuff for you.

## Installing Bower

Bower depends on [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). Install it globally with npm:

    npm install -g bower

Also make sure that [git](http://git-scm.org) is installed as some bower packages require it to be fetched and installed.
